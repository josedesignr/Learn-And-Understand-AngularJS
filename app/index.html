          <!--
            BUILT-IN DIRECTIVE: ng-show: Can contain any true/false validation.
            Pretty similar with ng-if, but this time, if validation is not met, this piece of HTML
            will be present in the HTML, but with "display:none !important"
            Here, we are validating if account.length is equal to our 'characters' variable (5)
          -->
          <div class="alert alert-danger" ng-show="account.length !== characters"> Must be 5 characters long! (validation with ng-show)</div>

          <!--
            BUILT-IN DIRECTIVE: ng-hide: Can contain any true/false validation.
            Exactly the same as ng-show, but inverse. This time if the validation is not met,
            the piece of HTML will be visible, if it's true, will be hidden.
            Here, we are validating if account.length is equal to our 'characters' variable (5)
            Notice that this time is saying "hide when lenght is EQUAL to 5"
          -->
          <div class="alert alert-danger" ng-hide="account.length === characters"> Must be 5 characters long! (validation with ng-hide) </div>

          <!--
            BUILT-IN DIRECTIVE: ng-class: Add a class (or a different) depending on a validation.
            Let's suppose we want to use a different bootstrap class, depending on different
            situations.
            Yellow: if it's less than 5 characters.
            Green: If it's equal to 5 characters.
            Red: If is more than 5 characters.
            We could do that easily with ng-class, check it out:
            (ng-class receives an object {} with the names of the classes as properties)
          -->
          <div class="alert" ng-class="{'alert-warning': account.length < characters, 'alert-success': account.length === characters, 'alert-danger': account.length > characters }"> 
            <!--
              And we can have directives inside of other directives, so let's also show a
              different message in each one of these cases, using the ng-show that we saw above
            -->
            <div ng-show="account.length < characters"> Less than 5 characters. (ng-class)</div>
            <div ng-show="account.length === characters"> Great! It's 5 characters. (ng-class) </div>
            <div ng-show="account.length > characters"> More than 5 characters. (ng-class) </div>

          </div>

          <!--
            BUILT-IN DIRECTIVE: ng-repeat: I can iterate over an array, and create a list of <li>
            by only putting one <li> here, all of them will be created by the repeat.
          -->
